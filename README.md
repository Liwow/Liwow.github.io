# Study@

** Project Description: 

Our project idea is an app similar to google maps and karma that we’ve named Study@, with the purpose of providing suggestions for good places to study (such as cafeterias and libraries). So far we have planned for the app to have ratings for Wifi-speed, power outlet accessibility, sound levels, space and price range of products sold at the location. Users will be able to leave ratings and reviews of the places and we also plan to have a checklist so the user can see quickly if the place has wifi and student discounts.

The app is so far planned to have a splash screen that leads to a main page. The main page features a map and a minimalized list of the places nearby, and also has a search function which will work with keywords (such as cafeteria, library, wifi etc). Clicking on a study place will expand it to a new page with more information about that place. There will also be an about page for the app, as well as a page for the user to leave their own reviews. 

We also have some stretch goals in mind given that we have the time, such as creating a login and user creation, the function to add places to a favorite list and so on. 

## Technology overview:

We’re not entirely sure what this means, but we assume it means the technology such as what API we intend to use and such. As we are using a map function, we will use the Google Maps API similar to the first lab, combining it with the design elements we did in the second lab. We’ll use onsen or reactNative as framwork.

## Time frame:

We expect to start working on the project alongside the final laboration, so our starting date will be when lab 4 is due (May 2nd). We aim to be done within the deadline.

## Names, roles:

Our group name is Cinos, with the following members. Note that the roles are only a starting point, as we expect to take on more roles during the process of the project.

- Elias Åkerlund, programmer 

- Ronya Budak, programmer and graphic designer

- Celina Zander, programmer

## Expected outcome:

Our expected outcome is of course a fully functioning app that fulfills the promises made in the description. If needed we might adjust things such as design. Depending on how we do with time, we will add as many of our stretch goals as we can. Hopefully we’re also done on time.
